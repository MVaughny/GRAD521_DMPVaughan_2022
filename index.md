# Data description

My research looks at count data of different invertebrate communities at different locations. At each sampling site we sample the ocean floor using a box core. This box core digs into the ocean floor and pulls up a large (1 square meter) sample of sediment and the marine organisms on and in the sediment. I then count the number of individual organisms we collect, which are identified at the species level. As my research is looking at the impacts ghost shrimp have on the community before and after their colonization, I will have two data sets per location - count data prior to the presence of ghost shrimp, and count data once ghost shrimp have established populations in that location. This information will be able to tell me what species are present in each location before and after the arrival of ghost shrimp, how many of each species are present, as well as their richness based on the number of individuals collected with the size of the area sampled. 

At each site sampled we also record environmental parameters. As we sample using a box core, a CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument is dropped at the same location to record data of various parameters, including: oxygen, salinity, pH, temperature, depth. Differences in these parameters may occur across both space and time, so the collection of this environmental data will help me discern if changes in communities could be linked to environmental variables as opposed to the presence of ghost shrimp. Sediment samples will also be collected and analyzed to determine the makeup of sediment (e.g., sand vs. clay), where sampling sites may be separated based on the sediment structure. As I aim to compare two different data sets (from pre-colonization and post-colonization), there is a temporal aspect to my data. 

The type of data collected is observational data and will be recorded in spreadsheets. This data will be entered from counts conducted in the laboratory from samples collected out in the field. The other data collected (e.g., environmental parameters) is stored as a text file in the instrument collecting the data, and then later processed into a spreadsheet. 

All of the data mentioned (count data, environmental data, location, time, sediment type data) will be stored in spreadsheets. In total, all data collected should fall between the size of 10 - 100 megabytes. 


# Roles and responsibilities 

Data Management Roles: My research is funded by an NSF grant written by the PI of the project. As part of the NSF grant application, the PI was already written a Data Management Plan (DMP) for the project. It is therefore the responsibility of the PI to implement and oversee the DMP, and her role includes being the data manager for the project. I am fully funded on the NSF grant and am the primary graduate student funded by this, so I therefore have a large responsibility in the data management and analysis (from here, I will refer to myself as ‘Graduate Student 1’). Weekly meetings conducted between the PI and Graduate Student 1 are already in place to ensure regular updates and reports on data management. 

The data is collected in the field on research cruises. In most cases, the PI will be the lead scientist of the cruise, however there will be a few cruises in the future where Graduate Student 1 will operate as the lead scientist. The data collection is overseen by the lead scientist, who manages the collection in the field. As this is cruise work, many hands are needed. Data will not only be collected by the PI and Graduate Student 1, but also other graduate students and undergraduates within our lab. It is the responsibility of the lead scientist on the cruise to ensure the data is collected and stored correctly. The role of data collection in the field includes taking physical box core samples that are exported back to the lab, CTD data, and written notes on the time and coordinates of box core drops. On the boat, the written notes are taken by the lead scientist on waterproof paper and then photographed to ensure there are two copies of the data. 
Box core samples and the CTD are taken back to the laboratory. It is the responsibility of Graduate Student 1 to generate the data, which involves collecting count data on the different invertebrate species collected from box core drops, as well as analyzing the grain sizes of sediment. The CTD will be connected to and uploaded to the lab PC, where data will then be extracted from the CTD and generated on the lab PC, of which Graduate Student 1 will be responsible for. This CTD will be maintained and calibrated by the manufacturer on a regular basis, and it is the responsibility of Graduate Student 1 to ensure this occurs. The particle size analyzer belongs to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and it is the responsibility of Graduate Student 1 to correspond with the EPA managers to ensure up to date maintenance of this equipment.

The data collected will be analyzed by Graduate Student 1, with the assistance of the PI when required. In the initial stages of the project, the PI is responsible for training Graduate Student 1 on the correct methods and protocols to analyze the data. Data will be analyzed in R and will be maintained by Graduate Student #1, including any metadata generation. A laboratory and field notebook will be used to note any data collection, generation, or analysis observations, and will be transferred to the lab PC and backed up on the cloud. It is the joint responsibility of Graduate Student 1 and the PI to archive and present the data. The PI will be responsible for quality and access control of the data, where they will review the analysis conducted by Graduate Student 1 and determine who else has access to the data. Lastly, the data collected is not sensitive or protected data. 

The contingency plan put in place is that if Graduate Student 1 were to leave the project, the PI will find another graduate student to overtake the project, including the graduate student’s role in data management. 

Data Sensitivity: The data collected does not include student or employee data, confidential donor information, or privileged attorney-client communications and minutes from confidential meetings, nor does it include any information under the ‘confidential data’ description provided by OSU. It is thereby determined that no sensitive or protected data will be collected, thus the data is unrestrictive. If this were to change, it would be the responsibility of the lead PI to ensure correct handling and measures are in place to protect this. 


# Data standards and metadata


# Storage and security

Data Storage: The data will be stored on a laboratory PC. It will be backed up on two external HDD’s which will be managed by the lead PI. Online versions of the data will be created and stored on Google Drive. Additionally, once data is ready for publication, it will be made publicly available online through Zenodo. 

Backup Strategy: In total, three hard copies of the data will be created (one on the lab PC and two on external HDD’s), along with two soft copies (Google Drive and Zenodo). Any notes collected in the field will also be stored in laboratory storage and photographed and stored in the aforementioned locations. The process to backup this data will be done manually and crosschecked between the PI and Graduate Student 1. The nature of this data strategy means that any data stored on a shared network drive or cloud system, will also be backed up as hard copies. Both my personal and university emails will have access to the data, and as overseen by the lead PI, when I graduate she will give me access to the dataset if I require it.
