# Data description

My research looks at count data of different invertebrate communities at different locations. At each sampling site we sample the ocean floor using a box core. This box core digs into the ocean floor and pulls up a large (1 square meter) sample of sediment and the marine organisms on and in the sediment. I then count the number of individual organisms we collect, which are identified at the species level. As my research is looking at the impacts ghost shrimp have on the community before and after their colonization, I will have two data sets per location - count data prior to the presence of ghost shrimp, and count data once ghost shrimp have established populations in that location. This information will be able to tell me what species are present in each location before and after the arrival of ghost shrimp, how many of each species are present, as well as their richness based on the number of individuals collected with the size of the area sampled. 

At each site sampled we also record environmental parameters. As we sample using a box core, a CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument is dropped at the same location to record data of various parameters, including: oxygen, salinity, pH, temperature, depth. Differences in these parameters may occur across both space and time, so the collection of this environmental data will help me discern if changes in communities could be linked to environmental variables as opposed to the presence of ghost shrimp. Sediment samples will also be collected and analyzed to determine the makeup of sediment (e.g., sand vs. clay), where sampling sites may be separated based on the sediment structure. As I aim to compare two different data sets (from pre-colonization and post-colonization), there is a temporal aspect to my data. 

The type of data collected is observational data and will be recorded in spreadsheets. This data will be entered from counts conducted in the laboratory from samples collected out in the field. The other data collected (e.g., environmental parameters) is stored as a text file in the instrument collecting the data, and then later processed into a spreadsheet. 

All of the data mentioned in question 2 (count data, environmental data, location, time, sediment type data) will be stored in spreadsheets. In total, all data collected should fall between the size of 10 - 100 megabytes.
